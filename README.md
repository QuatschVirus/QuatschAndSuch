# QuatschAndSuch
QuatschAndSuch is an environment, primarily designed towards commucation services/apps. In includes a central authentification system using tokens, and all the necessary requirements to easily integrate custom services.

The name is (rather obviously I think) rooted in my commom username "QuastchVirus", with Quatschen being german for "Talking nonsense" (or, more colloquially, "Yapping). Y'know, because it's for talking to (most of the time) people.

For more information on the individual services, check out their respective folders. 

## The architecture
Currently, all "services" are seperate from another, but can be combined to form a single app. For example, one could combine the Direct Message service ([Slider](https://github.com/QuatschVirus/QuatschAndSuch/tree/main/Slider)) with the (not yet existing) Group Chat service to create essentially a "normal" chat app similar to WhatsApp or the likes. You can aso just make a custom service that is interoparable with the existing systems.

## For the future
I plan to eventually add the following features:
- A group chatting service
- Maybe something along the lines of "server-based" communication (Think Discord, but without DMs)
- End-To-End file sharing
- And much more (if I can think of it)

Open to suggestions!

## Contributions
If you have an idea or a suggestions, feel free! This is open source for a reason. Just make sure to follow the set-out conventions (I'll maybe make an effort to actually define them, for now, just have a look at the code).
I'd be especially grateful for advice or help with databases and secure storage and commuciations, becasue this is my first ever encounter with actaul database systems (SQLite), and my first serious use of encrypted communications.
