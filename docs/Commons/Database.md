# public Database (Class)
`QuatschAndSuch.Database.Database`  

A construct for adding basic database functionality.
            Extend this class to create a Database model, and add a DbSet`1 for each table.
            Now just correctly define the type you want to make a table for using Attributes or the Fluent API
