# The QuatschAndSuch Wiki
This is the official documentation for QuatschAndSuch, both for implementing and modifying the services. The documentations are grouped by Service and mostly automatically generated. They should also reflect in the docuemntation information in the actual code using XML comments.
## Contributing documentation
Since the documentation is derived from the code comments using [DocsGenerator](https://github.com/QuatschVirus/DocsGenerator), to change the documentation, edit the offending comments in the source code, build the XML file, and run the tool for the entire assembly. For information about the tool, have a look at the DocsGenerator repository.
